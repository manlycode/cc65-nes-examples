Note: These examples are from [Shiru's NES programming tutorial](http://shiru.untergrund.net/articles/programming_nes_games_in_c.htm); I merely wrote a minimal Makefile so I could mess around on Mac OS X. The original readme follows.

This is a set of very simple examples of programming NES software in C using CC65 compiler and my low level code library. To get more information you can check out my article on this topic: http://shiru.untergrund.net/articles/programming_nes_games_in_c.htm

How to compile: download CC65 from http://cc65.org/, unpack into a directory, unpack this folder into that directory (where /bin/ etc is located), run compile_all.bat


Examples:

1. outputs some text
2. moving balls using sprites
3. pad polling and nametable updating when rendering is enabled
4. metasprites, two pads polling, collision detection
5. unpacking a RLE-packed nametable created with NES Screen Tool into the VRAM
